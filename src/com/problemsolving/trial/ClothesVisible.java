 * Consider the rope was of length N meters divided into N equal sections starting from 0 to N.
 *  Each cloth of width P occupies one or more than one section completely. (1<=P<=N & P is a +ve integer).
 * int length = 10;int clothes = 5;int[][] orders = {{0,4},{6,3},{1,5},{6,4},{7,2}};
 * Input Specifications Your program must read three arguments RopeLength, CountofClothes, ClothesPosition[]
 * where RopeLength is the length of the rope in meters (1<=RopeLength<=10000) CountofClothes is the number of
 * clothes which are placed on the rope (1<=CountofClothes<=10000) ClothesPosition is an array giving the
 * position in which the clothes were hung. The cloth position is described by two integers L and W, where L
 * represents the start position of where the cloth was hung (0<=L<=10000) and W is the width of the cloth
 * (1<=W<=10000).
